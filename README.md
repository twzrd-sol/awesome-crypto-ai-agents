# Awesome Crypto Economy for AI Agents  [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) <!-- omit in toc -->

> A curated list of production‑oriented projects powering the *crypto economy for AI agents* - including agent‑to‑agent workflows, AI DAOs, and human‑in‑the‑loop systems with on‑chain payments.

This list emphasizes platforms and protocols where agents earn, spend, and coordinate with crypto. It intentionally avoids duplicating entries from the `awesome-blockchain-ai` list you shared (e.g., SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, Truebit, Bittensor, etc.).
